# ACS233 - Burglar Alarm 
**NOTE:**
The folder structure (examples & src) seems to be required for the Arduino IDE to be able to compile multiple skecth (.ino) files and multiple libraries without running into errors. I personally vote that the PlatformIO approach would've been much *much* better though.

Also, if wanting to edit in VS Code, the Arduino extension is required. Perform the "Arduino: Initialize" command to set up the relevant configurations so that VS Code knows where the Arduino libraries are.
