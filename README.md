# ACS233 - Burglar Alarm 

**NOTEs:**
- The above code was mostly written in VS Code, but the main source code is meant to be uploaded using the Arduino IDE. Other tools such as PlatformIO were considered to centralise the writing and uploading, but we decided against it due to most of the team being unfamiliar with PlatformIO. I personally vote that the PlatformIO approach would've been much *much* better though
- If wanting to edit in VS Code, the Arduino extension is required. Perform the "Arduino: Initialize" command to set up the relevant configurations so that VS Code knows where the Arduino libraries are
- Certain lines of the FaceRecogWithGui.py file will need to be edited when running on different machines. Namely the serial port name and path to reference images
